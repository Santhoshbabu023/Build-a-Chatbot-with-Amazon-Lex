# Build-a-Chatbot-with-Amazon-Lex
In this project, I built a banking chatbot using Amazon Lex, designed to handle banking-related queries. I created intents like **WelcomeIntent** for greetings and configured **FallbackIntent** to manage unrecognized inputs. I also added response variations to make the botâ€™s replies more natural. The bot supports both text and voice interactions.
